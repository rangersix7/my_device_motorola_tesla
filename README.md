# Motorola Edge 2022 (tesla)              
# Code Name Tesla

# After a few weeks with this phone
# I have concluded that MediaTek has 
# it so locked down their is no way
# to get the files/blobs from phone
# or factory image. Rooting phone is
# not fully rooted. Cant pull vendor
# and/or sys files where the blobs are.
# Will stay away from MediaTek and
# Motorola from now on.
